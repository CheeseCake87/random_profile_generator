# random_name_generator
A quick random name generator.


All names in this are purley fictional and are not meant to represent real people. To change the first and last names you may copy-paste the code into a Python launcher then change them in the respective lists. Usage of this project is free, although you must credit WhineyMonkey10 in public use.
